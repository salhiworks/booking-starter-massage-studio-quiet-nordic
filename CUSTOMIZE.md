# Make this starter yours — the Claude Code prompt

Fill in the four lines at the top, then paste the whole prompt into a Claude
Code session opened in this folder. It changes identity and words only, so it
finishes in one short session.

```text
Customize this massage & wellness studio starter for my business.

Business name: <YOUR BUSINESS NAME>
City and region: <CITY, REGION>
Time zone (IANA): <e.g. America/Chicago>
Personality, in a few words: <e.g. classic and friendly, or calm and modern>

Follow CLAUDE.md (already loaded in this session — no need to open it again).
Open and change only these files; don't explore the rest of the project:
1. src/site.config.ts — name, timezone, and fictional previewContact details in my city.
2. index.html and admin/index.html — the business name, city and description in
   <title>, the meta description, and any og tags or <noscript> text.
   Also the name in public/favicon.svg's <title>, if it has one.
3. src/content/site.ts — rewrite every DEFAULT text for my business: the line
   above the headline, headline, introduction, section texts, FAQ answers and the
   search title and description. Keep field ids, types, limits and photos. Keep
   sample team members and example reviews labelled as samples. Headlines may set
   one or two words in *asterisks* (shown in italic) — keep that style.
4. Only if the current palette clearly doesn't fit my personality (otherwise skip
   this step and don't open these files): src/styles/tokens.css and
   src/admin-theme.css — adjust the palette, keeping every contrast ratio noted in DESIGN.md.
   If you change it, also update the same colours in index.html (theme-color),
   public/favicon.svg and the colour defaults in src/content/site.ts, and the
   colour table in DESIGN.md (if this project has one).

Do not change the layout, the booking flow, src/lib/engine.ts, src/lib/preset.ts,
src/demo/, supabase/, booking-engine.lock.json or package.json. Do not invent
services, prices, opening hours, awards, reviews, staff or details of the
premises you cannot know — services, prices and
hours are set in the dashboard. When done, run npm run build and fix any error,
then show me the result with npm run dev.
```

## After the prompt

- Replace the photos when you have your own: see `PHOTOS.md` for every frame.
  Or upload them later in the dashboard → Website.
- Connect real bookings: README.md, step 3.
